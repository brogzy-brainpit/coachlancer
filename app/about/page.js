          how it startedðŸ’¡
        </h3>
        <p className='py-2 t-medium font-normal'>
        Letâ€™s rewind to 2019â€”a year that changed everything for me. Iâ€™m Memet Oumar, the founder, owner, and the one-guy powerhouse behind inboxified and byMemet. Back then, I was a web developer with an appetite for challenges, and when I was asked to code my first email, I dove in headfirst. In the midst of crafting that email, a lightbulb moment hit: coding emails is really just putting together a bunch of boxes. That insight not only led to a triumphant first email but also sparked the emergence of a true email coding enthusiast.
        </p>
        <p className='py-2 t-medium font-normal'>

Since that memorable day, Iâ€™ve made it my mission to push email coding practices and standards to new heights. I firmly believe that every email user deserves a quality experienceâ€”regardless of whether their email client is cutting-edge or a bit old-school. Itâ€™s simply not acceptable for anyone to be stuck with a subpar experience because of technical limitations. For me as a developerâ€”and for you as someone who relies on sending these messagesâ€”we must collaborate to meet users where they are. If making an email shine in Outlook means writing extra code, then Iâ€™m all in. Every email client comes with its own quirks, but itâ€™s my responsibility to navigate those challenges and craft emails that deliver their message in the best possible way.

        </h3>
<p className='py-2 t-medium font-normal'>
Once you contact me, weâ€™ll set up an introductory call or chat to flesh out what kind of project you have. The most common request I get is to take a PSD, figma, or Sketch file and code it into an email that looks great in all clients. If you know the email client makeup of your audience, I can suggest some coding techniques that may enhance your subscriber experience. We then agree on a due date, and I begin coding. When production is complete, I will send you a ZIP file containing the HTML document and optimized images, as well as a link to screenshots of how your email will look in all major email clients.
</p>
<p className='py-2 t-medium font-normal'>
The process is the same for an email template. If you need a modular system, I will need access to your email service provider platform so that I may set up the modules and create the first couple of emails.
